# Intel Image Classification Project

## Overview
This project implements an image classification system using transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet-18 model.  
The goal is to classify natural scene images into six categories:
buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street.

## Methodology
The project follows a standard deep learning workflow:
- Data loading and preprocessing with augmentation and normalization
- Using a pre-trained ResNet-18 model
- Feature extraction and fine-tuning
- Model training and evaluation

## Results
- Validation Accuracy: 90.7%
- Test Accuracy: 92.8%
- The trained model was exported to ONNX format for deployment purposes

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- PyTorch / Torchvision
- KaggleHub
- ONNX
- Google Colab (for GPU support)

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in image classification tasks, achieving high accuracy while reducing training time.


## How to Run
